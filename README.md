# Week-02-Challenge
The second weekly assignment for my coding bootcamp.
# Description
This webpage acts as a portfolio for my deployed applications that I have made. It contains a short bio of myself, a section with links to each of the projects I have made so far (and some that I intend to make in the future), and some information about how to contact me.
# Usage
The page may be used as a launching point to view all my other projects, and as a way of finding out how to contact me. To view my projects, scroll down to the 'My Work' section of select the shortcut in the navbar. you may then browse my projects, and clocking on the one you would like to view will take you to that webpage.
To see how to contact me, scroll to the bottom or select the 'Contact Me' shortcut in the navbar.
